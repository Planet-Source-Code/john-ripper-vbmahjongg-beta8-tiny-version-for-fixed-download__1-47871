I'm coding this one just for fun. You CAN NOT use the material (GFX and Music) of this game for comercial purposes
because they have copyrigth (Kyodai Copyright)
If You use this one for comercial, not be a lamer and donate to Red Cross, Greenpeace, Save the Childrens or another else.:PPP

If you are not on right with this, you are free for delete this source code form your hard disk NOW!!!


Source Code
-----------

The source code was code in Visual Basic 5.0 Enterprise with Service Pack3 developed under OS W2k.
You can make any changes on it.

Some options are disabled because not are coding yet:P

The source has a "mininum" of comments, and the name of variables, functions and Subs are in the Shakespeare Language
(i'm normally use the Cervantes language, for this reason, don't be hard on criticism about this  :PPP )

The code should be "hard" for newbies. Don't email me for comment the code!, in case, email me to report bugs! xD

This is the first aproximation to the final VBMahjongg. Maybe in version 3.0 the subrutines are completly differents
and more accurate.

Remember that in this version there isn't ANY external LIB, DLL or OCX. Its made in "pure" VB Language. I'm plannig to make
a DirectX version, or Use the exceptional FX DLL (sorry, i dont remember the author now) to make a "faster" and more "good
looking" version.

This source was presented to PSC contest. I've you like it, vote me, and if you don't like it...well...What are you
doing reading this? :)


Game Rules
----------

Mahjongg Game.

The standard Mahjongg  Puzzle its "Traditional"

You may already know them... Just click on the tiles by pairs to remove them all. 
The only condition is that they must both be free : no tile ON them, and at least one side free -- no tile on their 
left or no tile on their right and above free, at least in the original rules. The tiles must be identical, except if they belong 
to a Flower or a Season family. In this case, they have to be from the same family. You will find only 
one tile of each kind, i.e. four season tiles and four flower tiles. For the other kinds of tiles, there are 
four of each (i.e. two pairs) on the board.


A improved version of Mahjongg its "Time Attack Mode". Just find correct pairs, but watch out Time!!!

Memory Game.

Just find a pair of same tiles to remove it from board. The game finished when all tiles are removed.

In "Extreme" level, the backface's tiles changes randomly to make game more difficult (and fun! xD)


I hope to see you on Version 3.0  :)


Dessing Your Own Puzzles
------------------------

You can dessing your own puzzles with the dessigner level editor. You can Change original puzzles or make new ones.
The maximun height its 5 tiles. Make sure that have 0 "Need Tiles" for "correct" puzzle boards.
This version of VBMahjongg its fully compatible with Layouts make by Kyodai.
